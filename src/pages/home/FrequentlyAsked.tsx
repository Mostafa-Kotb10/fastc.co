                How do I scan a drug without a barcode?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Our system uses your phone's camera and AI to detect drugs
                visually. Simply point the camera and touch the drug on the
                screen to add it to the cart. No barcode scanner is needed at
                all.

                What if my phone camera isn't working?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                No worries â€” you can still sell drugs. The app lets you search
                by drug name. You can add it manually to the cart.

                Can I use the system for multiple branches?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Yes, you can manage each branch separately. Each has its own
                database and user roles. Perfect for expanding pharmacy chains.

                Can the system manage drug expiry automatically?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Yes, when adding drugs to inventory, you must input the expiry
                date. The system calculates the proper shelf order based on
                expiry and uses it during sales. When a sale is made, the batch
                with the closest expiry is automatically deducted first.

                Is the system easy to set up and learn?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Absolutely. It&rsquo;s designed for non-technical pharmacy workers.
                Simple steps, intuitive UI, and helpful prompts. You&rsquo;ll get
                started quickly without special training.
